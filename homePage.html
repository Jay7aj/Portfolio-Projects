            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm <em>"Jayesh Annamkulangara Joshi"</em>. I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate who is an IT professional.
                I'm passionate about technology, new inventions and loves to know about their working principles and methods.
                You might be wondering how a Mechanical Engineer got into IT that too in coding.<button id="more">More</button>

        <section id="moreInfo" style="display:none">
            <p>This was because i was selected in my campus recruitment to an IT company <em>Infosys</em> who took me in and trained me to become and SDET(Software Development Engineer in Test).
                I was supposed to take up projects as an SDET. It was during this time that corona struck and all of us had to wait on bench for projects. This time infosys had a few openings in a
                 project where they needed IT professionals with mechanical background, where 
                I got the oppurtunity and had the chance to work in a project that greatly changed our carrer to application consultants.
                We were working side by side with engineers from different parts of the world in different departments all with the same goal of setting up a boiler power plant.
                Well i was in the <em>IT, product and application managemnt and consultant</em> department. we had the responsibilities to solve the technical requirements in the application they were using to design the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had the amazing oppurtunity to work with a wonderfull team of engineers for about 2 years, after which i moved to UK with my wife as she wanted to pursue her masters in the UK. I had to go on career gap 
                with the situations during those hard times. But now I'm trying to chase back my career.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                As an SDET in Infosys, I have worked on various projects 
                including bank applications, Database structures, and management applications.
                <br><br>
                The technologies and languages used in this project were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>Selenium</li>
                    <li>jUnit</li>
                    <li>Gherkin</li>
                    <li>TestNg</li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                As an AVEVA Consultant, I have worked on creating big databases, updating, removing and 
            sorting out client databases and their structures.
            I have had the oppurtunity to modify application based on client interest and adding 
            functionalities through automation which eased the handling time consumed during projects.
            <br><br>
            Here we were working with:
            <ul>
                <li>AVEVA PDMS</li>
                <li>E3d</li>
                <li>AVEVA Adminisration</li>
                <li>PML(Programmable Macro Language)</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>Online Servers</li>
                <li>VPN</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                All the above projects couldn't be recorded as they were all company assets.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of the projects I have done based on working with <em>codecademy</em> has and could be recorded
                and I have updated them in my <a href="https://github.com/Jay7aj/git_practice">GitHub</a>. This is still a work in progress
                and you can expect more codes to be added into this folder.
                <br><br>
                I was able to lear a lot more languages and get to have coding experience in :
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>GIT Bash</li>
                    <li>GitHub</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                </ul>
